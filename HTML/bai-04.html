                <td>Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level
                    data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming.
                    Pythonâ€™s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature,
                    make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many
                    areas on most platforms.</td>
